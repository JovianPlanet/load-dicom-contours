## DICOM CONTOURS

This is an API to load dicom contours from RTSTRUCT images and overlay it into its original DICOM study.

The user loads a DICOM RTSTRUCT and the application automatically looks for the corresponding DICOM image in the database. Then plots the images with the contour overlay.

The API also has other features for plotting DICOM images and surfing through DICOM metadata.
